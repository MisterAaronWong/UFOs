# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage with a dynamic table that shows information regarding UFOs based on multiple interactive filters that can be applied to narrow down the information search based on the user's desired input and criteria. The webpage was also lightly customized to make the page look more appealing and easy on the eyes. This was done using HTML and Javascript.


## Results
*There is a description of how to perform a search, with images.

In order to allow users to perform a search for the specific criteria, list elements were added into the index.html file for each filterable criteria (date, city, state, country, and shape). To keep track of all elements that change when a search is performed, a filters variable was created in the app.js file that stores the property "id" and the value entered from the user's input.


## Summary
*The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage (2 pt)
*The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development
